These progenitors emerge during gastrulation and contribute \nto both the neural ectoderm, particularly the spinal cord, and the adjacent \nparaxial mesoderm [D. Henrique et al., Development 142, 2864-2875 (2015); R. J. \nGarriock et al., Development 142, 1628-1638 (2015); E. Tzouanacou et al., Dev. \nCell 17, 365-376 (2009)]. However, effective genetic tools for lineage tracing \nand functional assessments of NMPs in vivo are currently lacking. Here, we \ndeveloped a dual recombinase-mediated genetic system to specifically trace and \nablate Brachyury+Sox2+ NMPs. Our genetic tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing \nanalyses revealed that NMPs consist of three distinct unipotent and bipotent \nprogenitor populations that progressively differentiate into neural and \nmesodermal fates. Genetic depletion of NMPs demonstrated their critical role in \ntrunk and tail formation. This study provides in vivo genetic evidence \nsupporting the heterogeneity of NMPs in terms of cell fate determination and \ntheir functional roles in the developing embryo.\n\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2402305122\nPMCID: PMC12002027\nPMID: 40178900 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests statement:The authors \ndeclare no competing interest.",
