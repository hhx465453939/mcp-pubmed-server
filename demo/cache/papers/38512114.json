However, the optimal treatments and \nmolecular correlates of benefits for FH-deficient RCC are currently lacking.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 91 patients with FH-deficient RCC from 15 \nmedical centers between 2009 and 2022 were enrolled in this study. Genomic and \nbulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed on 88 and 45 untreated FH-deficient \nRCCs, respectively. Single-cell RNA-seq was performed to identify biomarkers for \ntreatment response. Main outcomes included disease-free survival (DFS) for \nlocalized patients, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival \n(PFS), and overall survival (OS) for patients with metastasis.\nRESULTS: In the localized setting, we found that a cell-cycle progression \nsignature enabled to predict disease progression. In the metastatic setting, \nfirst-line immune checkpoint inhibitor plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ICI+TKI) \ncombination therapy showed satisfactory safety and was associated with a higher \nORR (43.2% vs. 5.6%), apparently superior PFS (median PFS, 17.3 vs. 9.6 months, \nP = 0.016) and OS (median OS, not reached vs. 25.7 months, P = 0.005) over TKI \nmonotherapy. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data revealed an enrichment of memory \nand effect T cells in responders to ICI plus TKI combination therapy. \nFurthermore, we identified a signature of memory and effect T cells that was \nassociated with the effectiveness of ICI plus TKI combination therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: ICI plus TKI combination therapy may represent a promising \ntreatment option for metastatic FH-deficient RCC. A memory/active T-cell-derived \nsignature is associated with the efficacy of ICI+TKI but necessitates further \nvalidation.\n\nÂ©2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-2760\nPMCID: PMC11145163\nPMID: 38512114 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
