With such data one might track heterogeneous cell \nsub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. \nRecently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting \nis an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual \ncells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput \ndroplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual \ncells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a \nsurprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other \nsequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in \ndetail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation \nafter leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these \nhigh-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and \ninfer gene expression relationships. VIDEO ABSTRACT.\n\nCopyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
