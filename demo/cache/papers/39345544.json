The specificity of T cells is \ndetermined by the sequences of the hypervariable T cell receptor (TCR) ɑ and β \nchains. Although bulk TCR sequencing offers a cost-effective approach for \nin-depth TCR repertoire profiling, it does not provide chain pairings, which are \nessential for determining T cell specificity. In contrast, single-cell TCR \nsequencing technologies produce paired chain data, but are limited in throughput \nto thousands of cells and are cost-prohibitive for cohort-scale studies. Here, \nwe present TIRTL-seq (Throughput-Intensive Rapid TCR Library sequencing), a \nnovel approach that generates ready-to-sequence TCR libraries from live cells in \nless than 7 hours. The protocol is optimized for use with non-contact liquid \nhandlers in an automation-friendly 384-well plate format. Reaction volume \nminiaturization reduces library preparation costs to <$0.50 per well. The core \nprinciple of TIRTL-seq is the parallel generation of hundreds of libraries \nproviding multiple biological replicates from a single sample that allows \nprecise inference of both frequencies of individual clones and TCR chain \npairings from well-occurrence patterns. We demonstrate scalability of our \napproach up to 1 million unique paired αβTCR clonotypes corresponding to over 30 \nmillion T cells per sample at a cost of less than $2000. For a sample of 10 \nmillion cells the cost is ~$200. We benchmarked TIRTL-seq against \nstate-of-the-art 5'RACE bulk TCR-seq and 10x Genomics Chromium technologies on \nlongitudinal samples. We show that TIRTL-seq is able to quantitatively identify \nexpanding and contracting clonotypes between timepoints while providing accurate \nTCR chain pairings, including distinct temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific \nand EBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses after infection. While clonal expansion \nwas followed by sharp contraction for SARS-CoV-2 specific TCRs, EBV-specific \nTCRs remained stable once established. The sequences of both ɑ and β TCR chains \nare essential for determining T cell specificity. As the field moves towards \ngreater applications in diagnostics and immunotherapy that rely on TCR \nspecificity, we anticipate that our scalable paired TCR sequencing methodology \nwill be instrumental for collecting large paired-chain datasets and ultimately \nextracting therapeutically relevant information from the TCR repertoire.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2024.09.16.613345\nPMCID: PMC11430070\nPMID: 39345544",
