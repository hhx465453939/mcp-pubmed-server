To \ninvestigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted \nskin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) \nflight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, \nsingle-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed \nspatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 \nskin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer \ndermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of \ngenes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These \nspaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including \naltered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell \nmigration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue \ncompartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin \nswab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and \ntimepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of \nastronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response \ncountermeasures.\n\n© 2024.
