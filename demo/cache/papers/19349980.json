Epub 2009 Apr 6.\n\nmRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell.\n\nTang F(1), Barbacioru C, Wang Y, Nordman E, Lee C, Xu N, Wang X, Bodeau J, Tuch \nBB, Siddiqui A, Lao K, Surani MA.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Wellcome Trust-Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute of Cancer and \nDevelopmental Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n\nNext-generation sequencing technology is a powerful tool for transcriptome \nanalysis. However, under certain conditions, only a small amount of material is \navailable, which requires more sensitive techniques that can preferably be used \nat the single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital gene expression \nprofiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, \nwe detected the expression of 75% (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques \nand identified 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5 \nreads. Moreover, 8-19% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms \nexpressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which \nunambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at \nwhole-genome scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1(-/-) and Ago2(-/-) \n(Eif2c2(-/-)) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553 genes, respectively, were \nabnormally upregulated compared to wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.1315\nPMID: 19349980 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
