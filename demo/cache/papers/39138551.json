However, how CAFs spatially coordinate other cell populations \nwithin the liver TME to promote cancer progression remains unclear.\nMETHODS: We combined multi-region proteomics (6 patients, 24 samples), 10X \nGenomics Visium spatial transcriptomics (11 patients, 25 samples), and \nmultiplexed imaging (92 patients, 264 samples) technologies to decipher the \nexpression heterogeneity, functional diversity, spatial distribution, \ncolocalization, and interaction of fibroblasts. The newly identified CAF \nsubpopulation was validated by cells isolated from 5 liver cancer patients and \nin vitro functional assays.\nRESULTS: We identified a liver CAF subpopulation, marked by the expression of \nCOL1A2, COL4A1, COL4A2, CTGF, and FSTL1, and named F5-CAF. F5-CAF is \npreferentially located within and around tumor nests and colocalizes with cancer \ncells with higher stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Multiplexed \nstaining of 92 patients and the bulk transcriptome of 371 patients demonstrated \nthat the abundance of F5-CAFs in HCC was associated with a worse prognosis. \nFurther in vitro experiments showed that F5-CAFs isolated from liver cancer \npatients can promote the proliferation and stemness of HCC cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified a CAF subpopulation F5-CAF in liver cancer, which is \nassociated with cancer stemness and unfavorable prognosis. Our results provide \npotential mechanisms by which the CAF subset in the TME promotes the development \nof liver cancer by supporting the survival of cancer stem cells.\n\nÂ© 2024.
