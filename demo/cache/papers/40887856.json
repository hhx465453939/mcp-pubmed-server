Germline \nTP53-inactivating mutations underlie Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a hereditary cancer \npredisposition disorder characterised by early-onset pan-tissue malignancies. \nHowever, the context-dependent tumour-suppressive mechanisms of p53 remain \nincompletely elucidated. This study aims to investigate the disruption of \ncellular homeostasis and tumourigenic mechanisms following p53 inactivation \nacross distinct cell lineages.\nMETHODS: Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) knockout mouse model was employed to study \nmolecular alterations under p53-deficient conditions. Multi-omics analyses - \nincluding single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell ATAC-seq, spatial \ntranscriptomics, whole genome sequencing, and CUT&Tag - were integrated to \nconstruct a Trp53 functional cell landscape. Deep learning-based gene network \nmodels were employed to reconstruct p53 regulatory networks and simulate in \nsilico perturbations caused by p53 loss.\nRESULTS: Our analyses revealed transitional dynamics in immune, stromal, and \nepithelial cells from normal physiology to p53-deficient states and subsequent \ntumourigenesis. These transitions implicated critical pathways such as cell \ncycle regulation, stress response, metabolic reprogramming, and immune \nmodulation, displaying both lineage-conserved and lineage-specific features. \nTumour-prone cell populations exhibiting elevated differentiation plasticity \nwere identified across lineages within tumourigenic trajectories. Spatial \ntranscriptomic profiling confirmed the emergence of thymic tumour-initiating \nT-cell clusters characterised by deterministic chromatin architectural \ndisruptions under p53-loss pressure. Notably, we uncovered a recurrent \nupregulation signature of ribosomal protein genes as an early pivotal molecular \nevent preceding malignant transformation in p53-deficient oncogenesis. Finally, \nwe decoded the p53 downstream regulatory network and computationally evaluated \nthe perturbation effects of genetic inactivation at single-cell resolution.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results elucidate the multiscale consequences of p53 \ninactivation while providing valuable resources for understanding tumour \npredisposition associated with p53-inactivating mutations and developing \nclinical interception strategies.\nKEY POINTS: Construction of a Trp53 functional cell landscape utilising \nsingle-cell multi-omics and spatial omics technologies. Reconstruction of p53 \ndownstream regulatory relationships with lineage heterogeneity via machine \nlearning-based gene network modelling. Dissection of shared and lineage-specific \nfeatures during cross-lineage tumourigenesis under p53 deficiency.\n\nÂ© 2025 The Author(s).
