While the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to \nthe bone field has led to major advancements in our understanding of SSPC \nheterogeneity, stem cells are tightly regulated by their neighboring cells which \ncomprise the bone marrow niche. However, unbiased interrogation of these cells \nat the transcriptional level within their native niche environment has been \nchallenging. Here, we combined spatial transcriptomics and scRNAseq using a \npredictive modeling pipeline derived from multiple deconvolution packages in \nadult mouse femurs to provide an endogenous, in vivo context of SSPCs within the \nniche. This combined approach localized SSPC subtypes to specific regions of the \nbone and identified cellular components and signaling networks utilized within \nthe niche. Furthermore, the use of spatial transcriptomics allowed us to \nidentify spatially restricted activation of metabolic and major morphogenetic \nsignaling gradients derived from the vasculature and bone surfaces that \nestablish microdomains within the marrow cavity. Overall, we demonstrate, for \nthe first time, the feasibility of applying spatial transcriptomics to fully \nmineralized tissue and present a combined spatial and single-cell transcriptomic \napproach to define the cellular components of the stem cell niche, identify \ncell‒cell communication, and ultimately gain a comprehensive understanding of \nlocal and global SSPC regulatory networks within calcified tissue.\n\n© 2023.
