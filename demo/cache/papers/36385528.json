Intratumoral host-microbiota \nstudies have so far largely relied on bulk tissue analysis1-3, which obscures \nthe spatial distribution and localized effect of the microbiota within tumours. \nHere, by applying in situ spatial-profiling technologies4 and single-cell RNA \nsequencing5 to oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, we reveal \nspatial, cellular and molecular host-microbe interactions. We adapted 10x Visium \nspatial transcriptomics to determine the identity and in situ location of \nintratumoral microbial communities within patient tissues. Using GeoMx digital \nspatial profiling6, we show that bacterial communities populate microniches that \nare less vascularized, highly immuno‑suppressive and associated with malignant \ncells with lower levels of Ki-67 as compared to bacteria-negative tumour \nregions. We developed a single-cell RNA-sequencing method that we name INVADEseq \n(invasion-adhesion-directed expression sequencing) and, by applying this to \npatient tumours, identify cell-associated bacteria and the host cells with which \nthey interact, as well as uncovering alterations in transcriptional pathways \nthat are involved in inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair. \nThrough functional studies, we show that cancer cells that are infected with \nbacteria invade their surrounding environment as single cells and recruit \nmyeloid cells to bacterial regions. Collectively, our data reveal that the \ndistribution of the microbiota within a tumour is not random; instead, it is \nhighly organized in microniches with immune and epithelial cell functions that \npromote cancer progression.\n\n© 2022.
