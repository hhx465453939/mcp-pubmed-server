This accounts \nfor approximately 25% of all new female cancers and 15.5% of female cancer \ndeaths. To address this critical public health challenge, we conducted a \nmulti-omics study aimed at identifying hub genes, therapeutic targets, and \npotential natural product-based therapies. We employed weighted gene \nco-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential gene expression analysis \nto pinpoint hub genes in breast cancer. Regulatory networks for these genes were \nconstructed by re-analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) \ndata from breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing \n(scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) were utilized to characterize hub \ngene expression profiles and their relationships with immune cell clusters and \ntumor microenvironments. Survival analysis based on mRNA and protein expression \nlevels identified prognostic factors and potential therapeutic targets. Lastly, \nlarge-scale virtual screening of natural product compounds revealed leading \ncompounds that target squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Our multi-omics analysis paves \nthe way for more effective clinical treatments for breast cancer.\n\n© 2024.
