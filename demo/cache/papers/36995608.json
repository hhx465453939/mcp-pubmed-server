Investigating the cellular composition of skeletal \nmuscle tissues and the heterogeneity among various cell populations is crucial \nto the unbiased understanding of how cellular networks work in harmony at the \npopulation level in the context of skeletal muscle homeostasis, regeneration, \naging, and diseases. As opposed to probing the average profile in a cell \npopulation, single-cell RNA-seq has unlocked access to the transcriptomic \nlandscape characterization of individual cells in a highly parallel manner. This \nchapter describes the workflow for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of \nmononuclear cells in skeletal muscle by taking advantage of the droplet-based \nsingle-cell RNA-seq platform, Chromium Single Cell 3' solution from 10x \nGenomics®. Using this protocol, we can reveal insights into muscle-resident \ncell-type identities, which can be exploited to study the muscle stem cell niche \nfurther.\n\n© 2023.
