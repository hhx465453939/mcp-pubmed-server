Here, we present cellCounts, a new tool \nfor efficient and accurate quantification of Chromium data. cellCounts employs \nthe seed-and-vote strategy to align reads to a reference genome, collapses reads \nto Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and then assigns UMIs to genes based on \nthe featureCounts program. Using both simulation and real datasets for \nevaluation, cellCounts was found to compare favourably to cellRanger and \nSTARsolo. cellCounts is implemented in R, making it easily integrated with other \nR programs for analysing Chromium data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: cellCounts was implemented as a function in R \npackage Rsubread that can be downloaded from \nhttp://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rsubread.html. Data and \nanalysis code used in this study can be freely accessed via La Trobe \nUniversity's Institutional Repository at https://doi.org/10.26181/21588276.\n\n© The Author(s) 2023.
