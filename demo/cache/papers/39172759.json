Overall, infiltrating \nimmune and stromal cells showed both intrapatient and interpatient variations, \nwith no uniform distribution over the lesion. We observed substantial \nheterogeneity at the copy number level within plasma cells, including the \nemergence of new subclones in circumscribed areas of the tumor, which is \nconsistent with genomic instability. We further identified the spatial \nexpression differences between GPRC5D and TNFRSF17, 2 important antigens for \nbispecific antibody therapy. EMD masses were infiltrated by various immune \ncells, including T cells. Notably, exhausted TIM3+/PD-1+ T cells diffusely \ncolocalized with MM cells, whereas functional and activated CD8+ T cells showed \na focal infiltration pattern along with M1 macrophages in tumor-free regions. \nThis segregation of fit and exhausted T cells was resolved in the case of \nresponse to T-cell-engaging bispecific antibodies. MM and microenvironment cells \nwere embedded in a complex network that influenced immune activation and \nangiogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation represented the major metabolic \nprogram within EMD lesions. In summary, spatial transcriptomics has revealed a \nmulticellular ecosystem in EMD with checkpoint inhibition and dual targeting as \npotential new therapeutic avenues.\n\n© 2024 American Society of Hematology.
