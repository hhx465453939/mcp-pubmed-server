We applied a semi-supervised analysis \npipeline to examine premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) \nthat can develop into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Their strict \ndiagnosis on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples limited the \nsingle-cell characterization of human PanINs within their microenvironment. We \nleverage whole transcriptome FFPE ST to enable the study of a rare cohort of \nmatched low-grade (LG) and high-grade (HG) PanIN lesions to track progression \nand map cellular phenotypes relative to single-cell PDAC datasets. We \ndemonstrate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), including \nantigen-presenting CAFs, are located close to PanINs. We further observed a \ntransition from CAF-related inflammatory signaling to cellular proliferation \nduring PanIN progression. We validate these findings with single-cell \nhigh-dimensional imaging proteomics and transcriptomics technologies. \nAltogether, our semi-supervised learning framework for spatial multi-omics has \nbroad applicability across cancer types to decipher the spatiotemporal dynamics \nof carcinogenesis.\n\nCopyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Inc.
