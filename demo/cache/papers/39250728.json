However, \naggregation of capture regions to single cells poses challenges. Bin2cell \nreconstructs cells from the highest resolution data (2 μm bins) by leveraging \nmorphology image segmentation and gene expression information. It is compatible \nwith established Python single cell and spatial transcriptomics software, and \noperates efficiently in a matter of minutes without requiring a GPU. We \ndemonstrate improvements in downstream analysis when using the reconstructed \ncells over default 8 μm bins on mouse brain and human colorectal cancer data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Bin2cell is available at \nhttps://github.com/Teichlab/bin2cell, along with documentation and usage \nexamples, and can be installed from pip. Probe design functionality is available \nat https://github.com/Teichlab/gene2probe.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.
