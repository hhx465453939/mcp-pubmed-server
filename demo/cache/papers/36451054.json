An essential prerequisite for \nscRNA-seq is the preparation of high-quality single-cell suspensions. So far, no \nprotocols have been described for preparing such suspensions from the placenta, \nan essential organ for fetal development and a site of maternal-fetal immune \ninteraction. Here we describe a protocol for the preparation of high-quality \nsingle-cell suspensions from human placental tissues-namely, the basal plate, \nplacental villi and chorioamniotic membranes. The protocol outlines the \ncollection of tissues from the placenta, tailored dissociation procedures for \neach tissue, and the cryopreservation of single-cell suspensions for multiplex \nsequencing library preparation. The protocol can be performed by a qualified \ninvestigator with basic working knowledge of placental structure. Moreover, the \nsingle-cell suspensions generated by using this protocol are compatible with \ndroplet-based scRNA-seq technology, such as the 10x Genomics Chromium system. \nThis protocol reliably produces single-cell suspensions from the placental \ntissues with high yield and viability for scRNA-seq. This protocol takes ~6 h to \ncomplete from tissue collection to cryopreservation of single-cell suspensions, \nand an additional 2 h for thawing of cryopreserved single cells.\n\nÂ© 2022.
