This lack of haplotype-level analyses can be explained by a \nlack of methods that can produce dense and accurate chromosome-length haplotypes \nat reasonable costs. Here we introduce an integrative phasing strategy that \ncombines global, but sparse haplotypes obtained from strand-specific single-cell \nsequencing (Strand-seq) with dense, yet local, haplotype information available \nthrough long-read or linked-read sequencing. We provide comprehensive guidance \non the required sequencing depths and reliably assign more than 95% of alleles \n(NA12878) to their parental haplotypes using as few as 10 Strand-seq libraries \nin combination with 10-fold coverage PacBio data or, alternatively, 10X Genomics \nlinked-read sequencing data. We conclude that the combination of Strand-seq with \ndifferent technologies represents an attractive solution to chart the genetic \nvariation of diploid genomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-01389-4\nPMCID: PMC5670131\nPMID: 29101320 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing financial \ninterests.",
