Mammalian β-galactoside-binding protein Galectin-3 (Gal-3) \nmodulates the host innate and adaptive immunity, and plays significant roles \nduring microbial infections including some fungal diseases. Here we show that \nthis protein plays a role also in C. neoformans infection. We find augmented \nGal-3 serum levels in human and experimental infections, as well as in spleen, \nlung, and brain tissues of infected mice. Gal-3-deficient mice are more \nsusceptible to cryptococcosis than WT animals, as demonstrated by the higher \nfungal burden and lower animal survival. In vitro experiments show that Gal-3 \ninhibits fungal growth and exerts a direct lytic effect on C. neoformans \nextracellular vesicles (EVs). Our results indicate a direct role for Gal-3 in \nantifungal immunity whereby this molecule affects the outcome of C. neoformans \ninfection by inhibiting fungal growth and reducing EV stability, which in turn \ncould benefit the host.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-02126-7\nPMCID: PMC5719036\nPMID: 29213074 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing financial \ninterests.",
