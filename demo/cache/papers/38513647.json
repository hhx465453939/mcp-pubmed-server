We generated transcriptomes of 446,267 cells \nand chromatin accessibility profiles of 401,875 cells and developed a package to \nanalyze 408,218 spatially resolved metabolomes. We find that the same cell type, \nincluding thin limb, thick ascending limb loop of Henle and principal cells, \ndisplay distinct transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, and metabolomic \nsignatures, depending on anatomic location. Surveying metabolism-associated gene \nprofiles revealed non-overlapping metabolic signatures between nephron segments \nand dysregulated lipid metabolism in diseased proximal tubule (PT) cells. \nIntegrating multimodal omics with clinical data identified PLEKHA1 as a disease \nmarker, and its in vitro knockdown increased gene expression in PT \ndifferentiation, suggesting possible pathogenic roles. This study highlights \npreviously underrepresented cellular heterogeneity underlying the human kidney \nanatomy.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
