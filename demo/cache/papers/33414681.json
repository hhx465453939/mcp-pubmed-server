So the technology to generate transcription expression or genomic DNA \nprofiles from single cells is crucial. Since its establishment in 2009, \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a major driver of progress \nin biomedical research. During the last three years, several new single-cell \nsequencing platforms have emerged. Yet there are only a few systematic \ncomparisons of the advantages and limitations of these commonly used platforms. \nHere we compare two single-cell sequencing platforms: BD Rhapsody and 10x \nGenomics Chromium, including their different mechanisms and some scRNA-seq \nresults obtained with them.\n\nÂ© 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.\n\nDOI: 10.2174/1389202921999200625220812\nPMCID: PMC7770630\nPMID: 33414681",
