CAFs were once thought to be a relatively uniform population \nof matrix-producing cells, but single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed diverse \nCAF phenotypes. Here, we further probed CAF heterogeneity with a comprehensive \nmultiomics approach. Using paired, same-cell chromatin accessibility and \ntranscriptome analysis, we provided an integrated analysis of CAF subpopulations \nover a complex spatial transcriptomic and proteomic landscape to identify three \nsuperclusters: steady state-like (SSL), mechanoresponsive (MR), and \nimmunomodulatory (IM) CAFs. These superclusters are recapitulated across \nmultiple tissue types and species. Selective disruption of underlying mechanical \nforce or immune checkpoint inhibition therapy results in shifts in CAF \nsubpopulation distributions and affected tumor growth. As such, the balance \namong CAF superclusters may have considerable translational implications. \nCollectively, this research expands our understanding of CAF biology, \nidentifying regulatory pathways in CAF differentiation and elucidating \ntherapeutic targets in a species- and tumor-agnostic manner.\n\nCopyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.
