Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and \nfunction, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad \napplication. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling \nthousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous \ndroplets, associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and sequencing \nthem all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of \nindividual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. \nWe analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 \ntranscriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene \nexpression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. \nDrop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine \ntranscriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.
