Disruption of this vast collection of intercellular \nand intracellular programs leads to pregnancy complications and developmental \ndefects. In the present study, we generated a comprehensive, spatially resolved, \nmultimodal cell census elucidating the molecular architecture of the first \ntrimester human placenta. We utilized paired single-nucleus (sn)ATAC (assay for \ntransposase accessible chromatin) sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), \nspatial snATAC-seq and RNA-seq, and in situ sequencing and hybridization mapping \nof transcriptomes at molecular resolution to spatially reconstruct the joint \nepigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory landscape. Paired analyses unraveled \nintricate tumor-like gene expression and transcription factor motif programs \npotentially sustaining the placenta in a hostile uterine environment; further \ninvestigation of gene-linked cis-regulatory elements revealed heightened \nregulatory complexity that may govern trophoblast differentiation and placental \ndisease risk. Complementary spatial mapping techniques decoded these programs \nwithin the placental villous core and extravillous trophoblast cell column \narchitecture while simultaneously revealing niche-establishing transcriptional \nelements and cell-cell communication. Finally, we computationally imputed \ngenome-wide, multiomic single-cell profiles and spatially characterized the \nplacental chromatin accessibility landscape. This spatially resolved, \nsingle-cell multiomic framework of the first trimester human placenta serves as \na blueprint for future studies on early placental development and pregnancy.\n\n© 2024.
