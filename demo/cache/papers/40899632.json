This study integrates multi-omics analyses-including ChIP-seq, bulk \nRNA-seq, single-cell ATAC/RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics-to delineate \nenhancer-driven transcriptional networks in 59 matched LUSC tumors and adjacent \nnormal tissues. The analyses identify 3,447 tumor-specific oncogenic enhancers \n(SOEs) enriched for master transcription factors (SOX2, TP63, KLF5, GRHL2) that \norchestrate malignant programs. Single-cell epigenomic profiling reveals these \nSOEs to be exclusively active in a cancer cell-like cluster, pinpointing PTPRZ1, \na receptor tyrosine phosphatase, as a top SOE-driven candidate. Functional \nstudies demonstrate that PTPRZ1 is essential for LUSC-tumorigenesis and tumor \ncells proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Spatial transcriptomic \nanalysis further implicates midkine (MDK) as the ligand activating PTPRZ1 in \nLUSC tumor tissue. Mechanistically, PTPRZ1 mediates MDK-induced PI3K \nphosphorylation that is essential for LUSC tumor growth. This work illustrates \nenhancer addiction as a hallmark of LUSC, identifies the PTPRZ1-MDK axis as an \nimportant targetable pathway, and establishes a paradigm for dissecting \nepigenetic vulnerabilities in solid tumors through multi-omics integration. \nThese findings advance precision oncology strategies for LUSC, bridging \nepigenomic dysregulation to therapeutic intervention.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).
