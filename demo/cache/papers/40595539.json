The popular and standard workflow for single \ncell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis applies feature selection, dimensional \nreduction, and clustering on the gene expression values quantified by read \ncounts, but alternative approaches using a simple classification of a gene to \n\"on\" and \"off\" (i.e., binarization of the gene expression) have been proposed \nfor clustering cells and other downstream analyses. Here, we demonstrate that a \ndirect concatenation of the binarized scRNA-seq data and the standard single \ncell ATAC-seq data is sufficient and effective for vertical integrated \nclustering analysis, after applying term-frequency-inverse document frequency \n(TF-IDF) and single value decomposition (also called latent semantic indexing, \nLSI) algorithms to the combined data, when the two data modalities are collected \nusing a paired multiomic technology. This proposed approach avoids the need for \nconverting scATAC-seq data to gene activity scores for combined analysis. \nFurthermore it enables a direct investigation into the contribution of each data \ntype for resolving cell type or subtype identity.\n\n© 2025.
