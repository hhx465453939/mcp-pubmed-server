We \nidentified extensive layer-enriched expression signatures and refined \nassociations to previous laminar markers. We overlaid our laminar expression \nsignatures on large-scale single nucleus RNA-sequencing data, enhancing spatial \nannotation of expression-driven clusters. By integrating neuropsychiatric \ndisorder gene sets, we showed differential layer-enriched expression of genes \nassociated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting the \nclinical relevance of spatially defined expression. We then developed a \ndata-driven framework to define unsupervised clusters in spatial transcriptomics \ndata, which can be applied to other tissues or brain regions in which \nmorphological architecture is not as well defined as cortical laminae. Last, we \ncreated a web application for the scientific community to explore these raw and \nsummarized data to augment ongoing neuroscience and spatial transcriptomics \nresearch ( http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD ).\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0\nPMCID: PMC8095368\nPMID: 33558695 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests Statement C.U., S.R.W., \nJ.C., Y.Y., and N.R. are employees of 10x Genomics.
