Grapevine \n(Vitis) breeders utilize disease resistance alleles from congeneric species ~20 \nmillion years divergent, but existing Vitis marker platforms have cross-species \ntransfer rates as low as 2%. Here, we apply a marker strategy targeting the \ninferred Vitis core genome. Incorporating seven linked-read de novo assemblies \nand three existing assemblies, the Vitis collinear core genome is estimated to \nconverge at 39.8â€‰Mb (8.67% of the genome). Adding shotgun genome sequences from \n40 accessions enables identification of conserved core PCR primer binding sites \nflanking polymorphic haplotypes with high information content. From these target \nregions, we develop 2,000 rhAmpSeq markers as a PCR multiplex and validate the \npanel in four biparental populations spanning the diversity of the Vitis genus, \nshowing transferability increases to 91.9%. This marker development strategy \nshould be widely applicable for genetic studies in many taxa, particularly those \n~20 million years divergent.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41467-019-14280-1\nPMCID: PMC6972940\nPMID: 31964885 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors affiliated with Integrated DNA \nTechnologies, Inc.
