The interplay between epigenetic regulation, transcriptional \nmodifications, and location-specific alterations within white matter (WM) \nlesions at the single-cell level remains underexplored.\nMETHODS: We examined intracellular and intercellular pathways in the MS brain WM \nusing a novel dataset obtained by integrated single-cell multi-omics techniques \nfrom 3 active lesions, 3 chronic active lesions, 3 remyelinating lesions, and 3 \ncontrol WM of 6 patients with progressive MS and 3 non-neurologic controls. \nSingle-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were combined and additionally enriched with \nnewly conducted spatial transcriptomics from 1 chronic active lesion. Functional \ngene modules were then validated in our previously published bulk tissue \ntranscriptome data obtained from 73 WM lesions of patients with progressive MS \nand 25 WM of non-neurologic disease controls.\nRESULTS: Our analysis uncovered an MS-specific oligodendrocyte genetic signature \ninfluenced by the KLF/SP gene family. This modulation has potential associations \nwith the autocrine iron uptake signaling observed in transcripts of transferrin \nand its receptor LRP2. In addition, an inflammatory profile emerged within these \noligodendrocytes. We observed unique cellular endophenotypes both at the \nperiphery and within the chronic active lesion. These include a distinct \nmetabolic astrocyte phenotype, the importance of FGF signaling among astrocytes \nand neurons, and a notable enrichment of mitochondrial genes at the lesion edge \npopulated predominantly by astrocytes. Our study also identified B-cell \ncoexpression networks indicating different functional B-cell subsets with \ndifferential location and specific tendencies toward certain lesion types.\nDISCUSSION: The use of single-cell multi-omics has offered a detailed \nperspective into the cellular dynamics and interactions in MS. These nuanced \nfindings might pave the way for deeper insights into lesion pathogenesis in \nprogressive MS.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/NXI.0000000000200213\nPMCID: PMC11073880\nPMID: 38564686 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors report no relevant disclosures.
