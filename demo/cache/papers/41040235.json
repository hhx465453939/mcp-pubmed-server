In the mouse \nvisual cortex, excitatory neurons in layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) form such a continuum \nalong cortical depth, patterned by the graded expression of hundreds of genes. \nHere we sought to understand how this continuum develops and contributes to \ncortical wiring. Using single-nucleus multiomics (RNA- and ATAC-Seq) and spatial \ntranscriptomics, we show that the L2/3 continuum is established in two phases. \nDuring the first postnatal week, a genetically hardwired program establishes a \nprimitive continuum of cell identities spanning the depth of L2/3. The second \nprogram, promoted by visual experience, is later superimposed upon the \npreexisting continuum. This second phase is driven by activity-regulated \ntranscription factors that drive the L2/3 depth-dependent expression of genes \nlinked to synaptic function and plasticity. We show that neurons at different \npositions along the L2/3 continuum project preferentially to distinct higher \nvisual areas and that visual deprivation disrupts targeting to some higher \nvisual areas while sparing others. Thus, cortical continua emerge through a \nstepwise process in which genetic programs and sensory experience specify \nneuronal identity and sculpt intracortical wiring specificity.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.09.22.677893\nPMCID: PMC12485764\nPMID: 41040235\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests The authors declare no \ncompeting interests.",
