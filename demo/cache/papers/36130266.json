The exponential growth of single-cell data has immense \npotential for large-scale integration and in-depth explorations that are more \nrepresentative of the study population. Efforts have been made to consolidate \npublished data, yet extensive characterization is still lacking. Many focused on \nraw-data database constructions while others concentrate mainly on gene \nexpression queries. Hereby, we present HTCA (www.htcatlas.org), an interactive \ndatabase constructed based on ∼2.3 million high-quality cells from ∼3000 \nscRNA-seq samples and comprised in-depth phenotype profiles of 19 healthy adult \nand matching fetal tissues. HTCA provides a one-stop interactive query to gene \nsignatures, transcription factor (TF) activities, TF motifs, receptor-ligand \ninteractions, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, etc. across cell types in adult \nand fetal tissues. At the same time, HTCA encompasses single-cell splicing \nvariant profiles of 16 adult and fetal tissues, spatial transcriptomics profiles \nof 11 adult and fetal tissues, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) \nprofiles of 27 adult and fetal tissues. Besides, HTCA provides online analysis \ntools to perform major steps in a typical scRNA-seq analysis. Altogether, HTCA \nallows real-time explorations of multi-omics adult and fetal phenotypic profiles \nand provides tools for a flexible scRNA-seq analysis.\n\n© The Author(s) 2022.
