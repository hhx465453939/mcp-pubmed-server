Epub 2013 Sep\n22.\n\nSmart-seq2 for sensitive full-length transcriptome profiling in single cells.\n\nPicelli S(1), Björklund ÅK, Faridani OR, Sagasser S, Winberg G, Sandberg R.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nSingle-cell gene expression analyses hold promise for characterizing cellular \nheterogeneity, but current methods compromise on either the coverage, the \nsensitivity or the throughput. Here, we introduce Smart-seq2 with improved \nreverse transcription, template switching and preamplification to increase both \nyield and length of cDNA libraries generated from individual cells. Smart-seq2 \ntranscriptome libraries have improved detection, coverage, bias and accuracy \ncompared to Smart-seq libraries and are generated with off-the-shelf reagents at \nlower cost.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2639\nPMID: 24056875 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
