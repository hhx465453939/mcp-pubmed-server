In this \npilot study, using 10x Genomics Chromium and Visium platform, we performed an \nintegrative analysis of spatial transcriptome with single-cell RNA-seq and \nsingle-cell ATAC-seq on lung cells from mice after immunization using a \nwell-established Klebsiella pneumoniae infection model. We built an optimized \ndeconvolution pipeline to accurately decipher specific cell-type compositions by \nanatomic location. We discovered that combining scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data \nmay provide more robust cell-type identification, especially for \nlineage-specific T helper cells. Combining all three modalities, we observed a \ndynamic change in the location of T helper cells as well as their corresponding \nchemokines. In summary, our proof-of-principle study demonstrated the power and \npotential of single-cell multi-omics analysis to uncover spatial- and \ncell-type-dependent mechanisms of lung immunity.\n\n© 2022 The Authors.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104900\nPMCID: PMC9418911\nPMID: 36039299\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.",
