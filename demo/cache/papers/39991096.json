This study \nleveraged multi-omics and machine learning approaches to uncover the prognostic \nroles of B cells in LUAD, thereby reinforcing the PPPM approach.\nMETHODS: We integrated multi-omics data, including bulk RNA, ATAC-seq, \nsingle-cell RNA, and spatial transcriptomics sequencing, to characterize the B \ncell landscape in LUAD within the PPPM framework. Subsequently, we developed an \nintegrative machine learning program that generated the Scissor+ related B cell \nscore (SRBS). This score was validated in the training and validation sets, and \nits prognostic value was assessed along with clinical features to develop \npredictive nomograms. This study further assessed the role of SRBS and SRBS \ngenes in response to immunotherapy and identified personalized drug targets for \ndistinct risk subgroups, with gene expression verified experimentally to ensure \ntailored medical interventions.\nRESULTS: Our analysis identified 79 Scissor+ B cell genes linked to LUAD \nprognosis, supporting the predictive aspect of PPPM. The SRBS model, which \nutilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, performed excellently in \npredicting prognosis and clinical transformation, embodying the preventive and \npersonalized aspects of PPPM. Multifactorial analysis confirmed that SRBS was an \nindependent prognostic factor. We observed varying biological functions and \nimmune cell infiltration in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) between the \nhigh- and low-SRBS groups, underscoring personalized treatment approaches. \nNotably, patients with elevated SRBS may exhibit resistance to immunotherapy but \nshow increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Additionally, \nwe found that LDHA, as an SRBS gene with significant clinical implications, may \nregulate the sensitivity of LUAD cells to cisplatin.\nCONCLUSION: This study presents a B cell-associated gene signature that serves \nas a prognostic marker to facilitate personalized treatment for patients with \nLUAD, adhering to the principles of PPPM.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1007/s13167-024-00390-4.\n\n© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, \nPreventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2024.
