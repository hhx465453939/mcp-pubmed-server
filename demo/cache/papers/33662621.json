The droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium (10X) \napproach and the plate-based Smart-seq2 full-length method are two frequently \nused scRNA-seq platforms, yet there are only a few thorough and systematic \ncomparisons of their advantages and limitations. Here, by directly comparing the \nscRNA-seq data generated by these two platforms from the same samples of CD45- \ncells, we systematically evaluated their features using a wide spectrum of \nanalyses. Smart-seq2 detected more genes in a cell, especially low abundance \ntranscripts as well as alternatively spliced transcripts, but captured higher \nproportion of mitochondrial genes. The composite of Smart-seq2 data also \nresembled bulk RNA-seq data more. For 10X-based data, we observed higher noise \nfor mRNAs with low expression levels. Approximately 10%-30% of all detected \ntranscripts by both platforms were from non-coding genes, with long non-coding \nRNAs (lncRNAs) accounting for a higher proportion in 10X. 10X-based data \ndisplayed more severe dropout problem, especially for genes with lower \nexpression levels. However, 10X-data can detect rare cell types given its \nability to cover a large number of cells. In addition, each platform detected \ndistinct groups of differentially expressed genes between cell clusters, \nindicating the different characteristics of these technologies. Our study \npromotes better understanding of these two platforms and offers the basis for an \ninformed choice of these widely used technologies.\n\nCopyright Â© 2021 The Authors.
