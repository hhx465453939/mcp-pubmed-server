However, the cellular and molecular understanding of PSD is still yet to \nbe illustrated. In current study, we prepared PSD rat model (MD) via unilateral \nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and chronic stress stimulation (DEPR), \nand isolated hippocampal tissues for single cell sequencing of 10x Genomics \nChromium. First, we determined the presence of the increased cell population of \nendothelium and microglia and the compromised oligodendrocytes in MD compared to \nNC, MCAO and DEPR. The enriched functions of highly variable genes (HVGs) of \nendothelium and microglia suggested a reinforced blood-brain barrier in MD. \nNext, cell clusters of endothelium, microglia and oligodendrocytes were \nindividually analyzed, and the subtypes with distinct functions were identified. \nThe presence of expression profiles, intercellular communications and signaling \npathways of these three cell populations of PSD displayed a similar but more \naggressive appearance with DEPR compared to MCAO and NC. Taken together, this \nstudy characterized the specific gene profile of endothelium, microglia and \noligodendrocytes of hippocampal PSD by single cell sequencing, emphasizing the \ncrosstalk among them to provide theoretical basis for the in-depth mechanism \nresearch and drug therapy of PSD.\n\nÂ© 2024.
