The concept of scRNA-seq builds \non traditional, \"bulk\" RNA-seq by recording and preserving the cellular origin \nof each transcript throughout library preparation. Here we describe an \nadaptation of the Drop-Seq method (Macosko et al. Cell 161, 1202-1214, 2015), in \nwhich nanoliter-scale droplets are used to physically separate dissociated \ncells, while a cell-specific DNA barcode is simultaneously introduced. Following \nbarcoding, cDNAs can be mixed and pooled while retaining the identity of the \ncell of origin. The benefit of the Drop-Seq approach is high throughput from \nrelatively small samples of tissue. The method described here is appropriate for \nprocessing an input of as few as 150,000 cells, with a final yield of as many as \n5000 single-cell transcripts captured.\n\nÂ© 2023.
