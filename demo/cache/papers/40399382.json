Hence, we integrated snRNA and ATAC-seq with high-plex single-cell \nmolecular imaging to generate a spatially-revolved multiomic atlas of human \nkidney disease. We demonstrate that in injured kidneys, a subset of \nHAVCR1+VCAM1+ PT cells acquired an inflammatory phenotype, upregulating genes \nencoding chemokines, pro-fibrotic and senescence-associated proteins and \nadhesion molecules including ICAM1. Spatial transcriptomic and \nmultiplex-immunofluorescence determined that specifically these VCAM1+ICAM1+ \ninflammatory PT cells localised to the fibrotic niche. Ligand-receptor analysis \nhighlighted paracrine signaling from inflammatory PT cells mediating leucocyte \nrecruitment and myofibroblast activation. Loss of HNF4α and activation of NF-κβ \nand AP-1 transcription factors epigenetically imprinted the inflammatory \nphenotype. Targeting inflammatory tubular cells by administering an AP-1 \ninhibitor or senolytic agent ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in murine \nmodels of kidney injury, hence these cells may be a tractable target in CKD.\n\n© 2025.
